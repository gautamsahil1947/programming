''' this is vim editor and it is cool in a number of ways 
        the first one is that it does not suggest you stuff so you have to learn all on your own 
        the second is that it doesn't auto complete the syntax like the parantheses.
        the third one is that it is simple yet powerfull and if you know git then a terminal would be enough for your coding life
